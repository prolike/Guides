# Label setup

You need to have GHI installed, and then you need to download this [script](https://github.com/Praqma/the-phlow/blob/master/phlow-labels)

**Caution! This removes all existing labels!**

You can then run the script, with the parameter --clean and then you should have some awesome labels.
